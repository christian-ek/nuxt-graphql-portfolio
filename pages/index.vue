        <p class="text-lg py-2">
          I am a Software Engineer living just outside of one of my favorite
          places in the world, Cleveland, Ohio. I am a self-taught programmer
          who firmly believes that you can accomplish anything in this life if
          you put your mind to it, roll up your sleeves and are willing to put
          in the work.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg py-2">
          I have been writing software for over 20+ years now and I use my
          knowledge, passion, and influence to help other developers achieve
          their goals. I teach online and currently, have over 160,000 students.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg py-2">
          In my personal life I am a husband to my best friend in the world and
          a father of two little girls. I enjoy reading, running and lifting
          weights to get me through the week.
